Mobile application project that offers the advantages of establishing an intelligent campus with agglomeration 
services as a system of systems that facilitate both teachers and students of the Higher Technical School of 
Computer Systems Engineering management and administration in the university campus, obtaining information from 
mobile data that allows optimizing the user experience as well as improving sustainability and energy efficiency 
on campus.

The application aims to facilitate the obtaining of data about the state of the university facilities as well as 
the user's experience in the university through a system of surveys based on the scoring of different categories.
In addition, the information useful for the user is centralized, from the information related to transportation 
services in the vicinity of the campus, to the information about the dining room menu, the contact information of 
teachers or the map of the university campus.
