The application makes use of crowdsensing techniques both user satisfaction through useful tools in their daily life in their university life, as well as collecting feedback from students for the university system, in order to improve the educational experience for all the members of the campus.

Campus integrates two types of functionalities. On the one hand, it incorporates unidirectionally oriented functionalities to the user, such as:

<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
  <li>map viewing with the coordinates established on the campus of the university,</li>
  <li>news viewing related to the university published in the account of the Twitter platform belonging to the teaching center,</li>
  <li>university task lists management</li>
</ul>
  
On the other hand, the application incorporates bidirectionally oriented functionalities for the user and for the university center:

<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
    <li>Incident management, which allows the user to report problems related to the center's material and facilities.</li>
    <li>Feedback on the subjects, teachers, facilities and the student's status.</li>
</ul>
